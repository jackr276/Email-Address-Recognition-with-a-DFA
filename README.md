# Email Address Recognition with a Deterministic Finite Automaton
Author: [Jack Robbins](https://www.github.com/jackr276)

## Introduction
This project uses a determinstic finite automaton(DFA) to recognize strings that are in a regular language of valid email addresses $L$, fully defined below. This markdown document contains the description of $L$, the illustration of the DFA for $L$, and the formal mathematical 5-tuple defintion for this DFA. The source file [dfa.cpp](https://github.com/jackr276/Email-Address-Recognition-with-a-Deterministic-Finite-Automaton/blob/main/src/dfa.cpp) contains an implementation of the DFA that allows a user to enter strings and view the real-time processing of them, and will determine if the string is or is not in the language. A more in depth descritpion of each item is contained below.
